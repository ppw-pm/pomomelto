# pomomelto
A productivity timer that turns focus sessions into a refreshing experience. Watch ice melt into your perfect drink as you work, earn stamps for completed sessions, and stay motivated with curated playlists.

## 📖 About

Pomomelto reimagines the Pomodoro Technique with a delightful twist. Instead of watching numbers count down, you watch ice slowly melt into a refreshing drink - a calming, visual way to track your focus time. Complete sessions to collect stamps and build your productivity journey!

**Pomomelto = Pomodoro + Melting** 

## ✨ Features

-  **Custom Focus Sessions** - Set your ideal focus duration
-  **Playlist Generation** - Get music matched to your session length
-  **Ice Melting Animation** - Watch your drink prepare as you focus
-  **Break Notifications** - Gentle reminders when it's time to rest
-  **Stamp Collection** - Earn and collect stamps for completed sessions
-  **Track Your Progress** - Build streaks and see your productivity grow

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Set Focus Time** - Choose your session length (25, 45, 60 minutes, or custom)
2. **Start Session** - Your playlist begins and the ice starts melting
3. **Focus & Watch** - The ice gradually melts as time passes
4. **Drink Ready!** - When the ice is fully melted, your drink (and break) is ready
5. **Collect Stamp** - Complete the session and add a stamp to your collection

## 🧊 Why Ice Melting?

Traditional timers can create anxiety with their countdown. Pomomelto uses ice melting because:
- **Calming** - Natural, ambient visualization
- **Rewarding** - Your drink is "ready" when you finish
- **Non-intrusive** - Gentle progress indicator
- **Satisfying** - Watching ice melt is oddly therapeutic!
